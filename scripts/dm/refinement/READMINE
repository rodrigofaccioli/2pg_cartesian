Molecular Dynamics are used to refine protein structure.

Steps to run Molecular Dynamics
1) check name files of protein structures contain pdb. If not, use script in scripts/checking/rename_to_pdb.sh
2) molecular_dynamics.sh starts the molecular dynamics in all nodes
	./molecular_dynamics.sh nodefile path_to_pdbs gmxpath

Important: 
	* nodefile must be contain name of nodes. It is not necessary inform anything more.
	* path_to_pdbs path where pdb files are. Here does NOT use / end of path
	* gmxpath is where gromacs programs are in each node. These must be in same directory.

3) reune.sh download all pdbs files
4) junta_pdbs.sh final preparation to be read the pdb files
